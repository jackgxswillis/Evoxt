# Build a Landing Page and Sell Your Product with LeadPages

## What is a Landing Page?

A landing page is a standalone web page designed specifically for marketing or advertising campaigns. Its primary goal is to convert visitors into leads or customers by encouraging them to take specific actions, such as signing up for a newsletter, downloading an ebook, registering for a webinar, or making a purchase.

When launching a product, SaaS idea, or even building an email list, a landing page can quickly validate your idea and attract initial interest.

## How I Used LeadPages to Launch My Product

Summer is almost here, and with it comes more outdoor fun. I’ve always loved having a Bluetooth speaker at the pool but hated dealing with a dead phone or the risk of my phone getting wet.

After some research and testing, I launched my product: **miniParty – Bluetooth Speaker**. It’s a magnetic Bluetooth speaker that holds your phone, charges MagSafe devices, and serves as a stand for watching videos while delivering high-quality sound. It’s the perfect device for summer!

To sell this product, I knew I needed:
1. A webpage with product information.
2. A way to capture customer details.
3. A payment system for seamless transactions.

Thus, I decided to use [LeadPages](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) and created a domain, **SpeakerParty.com**, for my product.

## Setting Up with LeadPages

### 1. Create a LeadPages Account

Sign up for a [LeadPages free trial](https://bit.ly/LEadPages). It allows you to test the platform and launch your landing page for 14 days without any upfront costs.

### 2. Add Your Domain

While you can use LeadPages’ default subdomain (e.g., `yourname.lpages.co`), adding your own domain makes your branding more professional. I linked my custom domain, **SpeakerParty.com**, to ensure my landing page was seamless and professional.
