## Why a Service Business Is the Easiest to Start

### Little to No Startup Costs
One of the biggest advantages of a service business is its minimal startup costs. Unlike product-based businesses, service businesses don’t require:

- Hiring employees at the outset.

Your primary costs might include a basic website, business cards, or flyers. For an online presence, platforms like [**Leadpages**](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) allow you to build professional websites and landing pages quickly and affordably.

### Fast to Launch
A service business can be up and running in no time. Here’s how to get started quickly:
- **Local Services**: Spread the word in your neighborhood for services like house painting, cleaning, or handyman work.
- **Online Services**: Offer skills like social media management, virtual assistance, or website design. Build a profile on marketplaces like Fiverr, Upwork, or Freelancer.com.

You don’t even need a website initially. However, creating one should be a priority as you scale. Tools like [**Leadpages**](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) make building a professional website easy, even for beginners.
